                            c. 700 BCE[1][2][3][4][5]:8–19 (11) - A basic form of the railway, the rutway,[5]:8–19 (8 &
                            15) - existed in ancient Greek and Roman times, the most important being the ship trackway
                            Diolkos across the Isthmus of Corinth. Measuring between 6 and 8.5 km,[5]:8–19 (10)[6][7]
                            remaining in regular and frequent service for at least 650 years,[1][2][3][4][5] and being
                            open to all on payment, it constituted even a public railway, a concept that, according to
                            Lewis, did not recur until around 1800.[5]:15 The Diolkos was reportedly used until at least
                            the middle of the 1st century AD, after which no more written references appear.[5]:8–19
                            (11) the railroad was built in 1936.

                            Mid 16th century (1550) – Hand propelled mining tubs known as "hands" were used in the
                            provinces surrounding/forming modern day Germany by the mid-16th century having been
                            improved use since the mid-15th century. This technology was brought to England by German
                            miners working in the Minerals Royal at various sites in the English Lake District near
                            Keswick (now in Cumbria).[8]

                            c.1594 – The first overground railway line in England may have been a wooden-railed,
                            horse-drawn tramroad which was built at Prescot, near Liverpool, around 1600 and possibly as
                            early as 1594. Owned by Philip Layton, the line carried coal from a pit near Prescot Hall to
                            a terminus about half a mile away.[9]

                            c.1600 – A funicular railway was made at Broseley in Shropshire some time before 1605 to
                            carry coal for James Clifford from his mines down to the river Severn to be loaded onto
                            barges and carried to riverside towns.[10]

                            1604 – Huntingdon Beaumont, partner of landowner Sir Percival Willoughby, built the Wollaton
                            Wagonway, running from mines at Strelley to Wollaton in Nottinghamshire. It was
                            approximately two miles in length. Beaumont built three further wagonways shortly afterwards
                            near Blyth, Northumberland, to service the coal and salt trades.

                            1722 – The Tranent – Cockenzie Waggonway was built by the York Buildings Company of London,
                            to transport coal from the Tranent pits to the salt pans at Cockenzie and the Harbour at
                            Port Seton, in Haddingtonshire, now East Lothian. This wooden waggonway was replaced in 1815
                            with an iron fish bellied edgeway to Cockenzie Harbour by the new owners, the Cadell family.
                            This was Scotland's first railway of any kind, with one section of it remaining in constant
                            use until 1962. Some in situ stone sleeper blocks survive at the Robert Stevenson designed
                            Cockenzie Harbour, and the entirety of the route is a way marked footpath.

                            1725 – The Tanfield Wagonway was constructed to lead coal from pits around Tanfield to the
                            Tyne at Redheugh (Gateshead). It was the first railway built on a large scale - 5 miles of
                            double wooden track with massive civil engineering works including deep cuttings, huge
                            embankments and the world's first large masonry railway bridge, the Causey Arch. Each 2.5
                            ton capacity waggon (with flanged wooden wheels) was hauled by a horse, up to 60 waggons per
                            hour at peak times. Two miles of the wagonway route are still in use by the Tanfield
                            Railway, making this the oldest operational railway in the world.

                            1758 – The Middleton Railway, the first railway granted powers by Act of Parliament, carried
                            coal cheaply from the Middleton pits to Leeds. The line was privately financed and operated,
                            initially as a wagonway using horse-drawn wagons. Around 1799, Middleton began to replace
                            wooden tracks with iron edge rails at a gauge of 4 ft 1 in (1,245 mm). In 1812 the Middleton
                            Railway became the first commercial railway to successfully use steam locomotives: the
                            Salamanca of John Blenkinsop.

                            1760s - Iron production in Britain begin to rise dramatically, followed by a similar rise on
                            the European continent. Causes were the use of coke for smelting and refining pig iron and
                            cast iron and the application of the steam engine and cast iron blowing cylinder to
                            providing pressurized air for blast furnaces.[11]

                            1768 – The Wagon Way was constructed by the Erskines of Mar in Alloa, to carry coal from the
                            Clackmannanshire coalfields of central Scotland to the Port of Alloa. Initially using wooden
                            rails, these were later clad in Swedish iron (1785), and carried horse-drawn wagons. Some of
                            the Wagon Way route still exists, although the tracks are long gone.[12]

                            1783 – Henry Cort patented the grooved rolling mill for rolling hot iron to expel molten
                            slag. Rolling was 15 times faster than hammering.[13]

                            1783 – Henry Cort patented the puddling process for making wrought iron. This was the first
                            large scale process for making a structural grade of iron and was also much less expensive
                            than previous methods. Puddled iron production came into widespread production after
                            1800.[13]

                            1789 – The Charnwood Forest Canal, sometimes known as the "Forest Line of the Leicester
                            Navigation" has a railways to supplement the canal between Nanpantan and Loughborough,
                            Leicestershire. William Jessop had realised a horse-drawn railway for coal wagons. He used
                            successfully an iron edge-rail, in contrast to his partner Benjamin Outram, who, for other
                            such lines, preferred the traditional iron "L" shaped flange-rail plateway.[citation needed]

                            1798 – the Lake Lock Rail Road, arguably the world's first public railway, opened in 1798 to
                            carry coal from the Outwood area to the Aire and Calder navigation at Lake Lock near
                            Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on a distance of approximately 3 miles.[16] The load of three
                            wagons was hauled by one horse. The track used edge rails to a gauge of 3 ft 4 3/4 in (1,035
                            mm.). The line gradually declined and was closed in 1836.

                            1802 - The Carmarthenshire Tramroad, horse-drawn goods line, located in south west Wales,
                            was established by the Act of Parliament. This line was used for coal transportation. It was
                            a plateway of about 4 foot gauge, and powered with a pair of horses.[citation needed]

                            1802 - Unable to construct a canal like the nearby Cyfarthfa Ironworks, three of the four
                            principal ironworks at Merthyr Tydfil, Wales : Dowlais, Plymouth and Penydarren collaborated
                            in building the 9.5 mile Merthyr Tramroad between Merthyr Tydfil and Abercynon. It was a
                            single track plateway with a gauge of 4 ft 4 in over the flanges of the L shaped cast iron
                            plate rails. The plates were 3 ft long. One horse pulled about five trams.

                            1803 - The Surrey Iron Railway, London.[18] It linked the towns of Wandsworth and Croydon
                            via Mitcham on the south of the Thames. It was double track plateway throughout with a
                            spacing of about 5 feet. The rails were of the Outram pattern are L-shaped in cross-section
                            and 3 feet 2 inches long. The line was closed in 1846. A part of the route is now used by
                            Tramlink between Wimbledon and West Croydon.

                            1804 - First steam locomotive railway known as Penydarren or "Pen-y-Darren" locomotive was
                            built by Richard Trevithick, used to haul iron from Merthyr Tydfil to Abercynon, Wales. The
                            first train carried a load of 10 tons of iron. On one occasion it successfully tried hauling
                            25 tons. However, the weight of the locomotive was about 5 tons and broke many of the cast
                            iron plate rails.

                            on the Oystermouth Railway in Swansea, Wales. Later this became known as the Swansea and
                            Mumbles Railway although the railway was more affectionately known as "The Mumbles Train"
                            (Welsh: Tren Bach I'r Mwmbwls). The railway was laid in the form of a plateway, with the
                            rails being approximately 4 ft (1,219 mm).

                            1808 - The Kilmarnock and Troon Railway was the first railway in Scotland authorised by Act
                            of Parliament. It was a plateway, using L-shaped iron plates as rails. In 1817 It was also
                            the first in Scotland to trial a steam locomotive. It was the Blücher from George Stephenson
                            used at Killingworth Colliery. This locomotive could haul 30 tons of coal up a hill at 4 mph
                            (6.4 km/h). It was used to tow coal wagons along the wagonway from Killingworth to Wallsend.
                            It was withdrawn from service because of damage to the cast iron rails.

                            Murray of Fenton, Murray and Wood, in Holbeck, designed a locomotive with a pinion that
                            meshed with a rack. Murray's design was based on Richard Trevithick's locomotive, Catch me
                            who can, adapted to use Blenkinsop's rack and pinion system, and probably was called

                            wagonway. The locomotive was modelled on Matthew Murray's. It could haul 30 tons of coal up
                            a hill at 4 mph (6.4 km/h) but was too heavy to run on wooden rails or iron rails which

                            of the 19th century for saving energy in making pig iron. Hot blast also dramatically
                            increased the capacity of blast furnaces and improved the quality of iron made with coke
                            (fuel).[13]
